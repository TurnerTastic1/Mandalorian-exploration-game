Shoan Madar: Hello. My name is Shoan Madar. You must be a Mandalorian; I can tell from your shiny armor. 
What are you doing on Tython?
Darro Anen sent you? It's been a while since I've seen him. I'm glad to know he's doing well

Well, he's right about one thing. I have information about the Jedi Order, but I need your help first. 
A storm blew over the fence for my livestock. Will you help me repair it?

Do you accept the quest? It will cost you ___ credits for manual labor.

~yes~
*subtract coins*
*wait some time*
You have repaired the fence.

Shoan Madar: Thank you for helping me. It would have taken me days to fix it by myself.
Shoan Madar: Now for the information you are looking for. 
Tython used to be home to the Jedi Order. The Jedi were an order of warrior monks who kept peace in the universe.
They were so peaceful that they were able to connect the life force of the universe and use it to gain extrodinary powers and strength.
One of the temples on Tython was used for training Jedi padawons. If you go to Region 3, you will find this temple. 
If you bring your youngling there, he may strengthen his powers. 
If you want to learn more about your Mandalorian friends. I would suggest going to region 1 of the planet Trask . The last visitor I met mentioned a gang of Mandalorians stirring up trouble there. 
That is all I have. Good luck.
