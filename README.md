Welcome to the Star Wars Mandalorian exploration game! In this game you will play as the main character
from the Star Wars tv show, 'Mando', in an alternate universe. As you explore the galaxy you will collect

This game was developed as a final project for CSCI 1300 at CU Boulder by Turner and Cassie.
