Well, he's right about one thing. I have information about the Jedi Order, but I need your help first. 
A storm blew over the fence for my livestock. Will you help me repair it?

Shoan Madar: Now for the information you are looking for. 
Tython used to be home to the Jedi Order. The Jedi were an order of warrior monks who kept peace in the universe.
They were so peaceful that they were able to connect the life force of the universe and use it to gain extrodinary powers and strength.
One of the temples on Tython was used for training Jedi padawons. If you go to Region 3, you will find this temple. 
If you bring your youngling there, he may strengthen his powers. 
That is all I have. Good luck.
